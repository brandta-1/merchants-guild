# merchants-guild
Repository for my [Dark and Darker](https://www.darkanddarker.com/) trading site

## Deployment

MongoDB Atlas does not allow server-side JavaScript on their free clusters<sup>[[1](https://github.com/brandta-1/merchants-guild/blob/main/server/controller/listing-controller.js#L152)][[2](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/reference/free-shared-limitations/)]</sup>. So you can preview the site [here](https://traders-guild-a1de141fdce9.herokuapp.com/), but it is currently non-functioning.

## Preview
Navigate to the Create Listings page, and enter the items you'd like to trade, and the name of your character that owns those items.

On the Search Listings page, you can use a similar form to find characters buying and selling items you want

The search results are displayed below, ordered by closest match, custom filtering and sorting will be added.
